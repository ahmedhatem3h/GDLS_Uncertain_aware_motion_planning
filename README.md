Uncertainty-Aware Motion Planning for Ground Vehicles

This repository contains the implementation of a framework for Uncertainty-Aware Motion Planning in Unstructured and Uneven Off-Road Terrain. The framework addresses challenges such as terrain uncertainty and large-scale environments using a multi-query planner and stochastic graph representation. It integrates geometric and semantic terrain data and utilizes a Complete AO* (CCAO*) algorithm to handle uncertainty and ensure optimal navigation policies.
Features

    Integration of geometric and semantic terrain data for accurate terrain assessment.
    Uncertainty-aware motion planning with unsupervised region clustering.
    Generation of stochastic graph representations.
    Use of the Complete CAO* (CCAO*) algorithm for solving the Canadian Traveler Problem (CTP).
    Simulation-ready with real-world off-road data for performance testing.
